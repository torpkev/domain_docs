# Flags

Domain has over 200 flags that can be combined in order to grant or prevent access to nearly anything in the game.

Each flag can be either true or false.  If true, the flag is active in that field, if false, the flag is not active in that field.  

    FLAGNAME_1: true
    FLAGNAME_2: false

Nested fields allow for more complex mixes of contradictory flags, for example, if the parent field has this:

    FLAGNAME_1: true
    FLAGNAME_2: true
    
And the child field had:

    FLAGNAME_1: false


FLAGNAME_1 would be active in the parent field, but not the child, but FLAGNAME_2 would be active in both parent and child.

A full breakdown of each flag is listed below:
