# Creating New Blocks

[Home](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs)

Getting the Domain Blocks set up the way you want them is the most important thing for your server.  
While the default blocks cover some basic functionality, Domain really shines when you configure things the way it best makes sense for YOUR server.

There are several considerations to keep in mind when creating your own Domain Blocks

- What is the overall purpose?
- What flags do you need
- How big should it be?
- Do you want the user to be able to resize?
- Should they be able to merge them?
- Is it a server owned field (spawn etc.?)
- Is it a specialty field such as a mob spawning or teleport field?
- Is this a field in its own right, or used for adding features in a small area? (mob allow etc.)

These decisions should guide the creation of a field, but with experience and experimentation, you should have little difficulty crafting your available Domain blocks with ease. 

Below is a simple grief prevent field that explains each entry that needs to be completed.
