Domain comes with several pre-configured fields that may suit your needs, however, due to the configurable nature of Domain, it is strongly recommended that you use them only as a reference to design your own fields.

- city.yml - A large area designed to cover multiple buildings and provide a high level of protection
- cow.yml - A cow spawning field, intended as a replacement for a cow spawner
- custom.yml - A field that is intended as a simple add-on by an admin.  Excellent for testing combinations of flags
- fly.yml - A field that allows flying within it
- griefprevent.yml - A simple grief protection field, intended for a single building/area
- moballow.yml - An add-on field, intended to be placed with a City field, and allows spawning of mobs within it (excellent for mob grinders)
- nofly.yml - A field that prevents Elytra gliding
- nopvp.yml - Prevents player vs player fighting
- teleport.yml - A simple teleport portal field.  Set the location and you will be teleported when you enter the field
- zombie.yml - A zombie spawning field, intended as a replacement for a zombie mob spawner
