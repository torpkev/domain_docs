### Configuration

You can control how Domain works by altering config.yml, while flags.yml, gui.yml and lang.yml give you control over the language and blocks used in menus.

- [config.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/config.yml)

- [flags.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/flags.yml)
  > There is also an alternate version here that uses different blocks for different flags.  This is designed for 1.16 and likely will not work in prior versions:
  > [flags.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/user/dad4service/flags.yml) - Provided by Dad4Service

- [gui.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/gui.yml)

- [lang.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/lang.yml) - See more information on the language file by clicking [here](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/language)

### Domain Blocks

Domain comes with several pre-configured fields that may suit your needs, however, due to the configurable nature of Domain, it is strongly recommended that you use them only as a reference to design your own fields.

- [city.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - A large area designed to cover multiple buildings and provide a high level of protection

- [cow.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/cow.yml) - A cow spawning field, intended as a replacement for a cow spawner

- [custom.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/custom.yml) - A field that is intended as a simple add-on by an admin.  Excellent for testing combinations of flags

- [fly.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/fly.yml) - A field that allows flying within it

- [griefprevent.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/griefprevent.yml) - A simple grief protection field, intended for a single building/area

- [moballow.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/moballow.yml) - An add-on field, intended to be placed with a City field, and allows spawning of mobs within it (excellent for mob grinders)

- [nofly.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/nofly.yml) - A field that prevents Elytra gliding

- [nopvp.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/nopvp.yml) - Prevents player vs player fighting

- [teleport.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/teleport.yml) - A simple teleport portal field.  Set the location and you will be teleported when you enter the field

- [zombie.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/zombie.yml) - A zombie spawning field, intended as a replacement for a zombie mob spawner
