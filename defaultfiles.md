Domain comes with several pre-configured fields that may suit your needs, however, due to the configurable nature of Domain, it is strongly recommended that you use them only as a reference to design your own fields.

- [city.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - A large area designed to cover multiple buildings and provide a high level of protection
- [cow.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - A cow spawning field, intended as a replacement for a cow spawner
- [custom.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - A field that is intended as a simple add-on by an admin.  Excellent for testing combinations of flags
- [fly.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - A field that allows flying within it
- [griefprevent.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - A simple grief protection field, intended for a single building/area
- [moballow.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - An add-on field, intended to be placed with a City field, and allows spawning of mobs within it (excellent for mob grinders)
- [nofly.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - A field that prevents Elytra gliding
- [nopvp.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - Prevents player vs player fighting
- [teleport.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - A simple teleport portal field.  Set the location and you will be teleported when you enter the field
- [zombie.yml](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/city.yml) - A zombie spawning field, intended as a replacement for a zombie mob spawner
