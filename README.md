Domain is designed for Spigot for Minecraft 1.13/1.14/1.15/1.16, has over 150 flags that can be mixed together to form custom Domain blocks. These blocks can be provided or sold to your players to protect their builds from monsters and other players.

It features a simple to use block management system that will allow your users to resize their field, to enable/disable their fields, display the field boundaries or even make sub-fields which they can rent out to other players.

Domain utilizes Vault for renting fields, however, if you'd rather not use Vault, the plugin will continue to function without the economy hook.

Domain can also utilize Myriad Clans to allow your clan into the field. Myriad Clans is NOT required for Domain to run, but provides clan access when it is. As a registered buyer of Domain, you can request a free copy of Myriad Clans by contacting me directly.

Best of all, Domain is being actively developed, so you're not stuck with an outdated plugin that you can't use.
