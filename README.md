Domain is a land claiming & protection plugin for Spigot/Paper 1.13 - 1.16

It features a simple to use block management system that will allow your users to resize their field, to enable/disable their fields, display the field boundaries or even make sub-fields which they can rent out to other players.

There are over 200 flags that can be applied to fields to do everything from preventing unauthorized players from accessing your anything in your field, including chests, doors, gates etc., protecting players and mobs, preventing access into a field completely, allowing players to fly in their own field, creating teleport portals, creating a mob spawner field and much much more.

Domain utilizes Vault for renting fields, however, if you'd rather not use Vault, the plugin will continue to function without the economy hook.

Domain can also utilize Myriad Clans to allow your clan into the field. Myriad Clans is NOT required for Domain to run, but provides clan access when it is. As a registered buyer of Domain, you can request a free copy of Myriad Clans by contacting me directly.

Best of all, Domain is being actively developed, so you're not stuck with an outdated plugin that you can't use.
