- Left click the first corner of the cuboid with the Resize wand in your main hand

- Right click the second corner of the cuboid with the Resize wand in your main hand

- Validation is done each time you set a corner - if the background is red, you will not be able to resize the field.  Review the message on screen and make changes as necessary.
  Potential issues may include:
  - Block is not in field (The Domain Block may need to be within the cuboid
  - Selected volume exceeds Block volume
  - Block may be overlapping another field

- Once your cuboid is set correctly, right click the Domain Block with the Resize wand in your main hand

- You should see a message telling you that the field is resized.  You can use the following command to visualize your resized field

      /domain display
