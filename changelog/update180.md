# Change Log 1.8.0

[Home](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs)

This is a massive update for Domain - roughly 70% of the code has been rewritten from scratch, including the core DomainBlock classes, visualization, reading/writing from the yml files, and removal of a lot of duplicated code and classes.

Due to the extent of the change, please note the following:
BACKUP YOUR DOMAIN FOLDER AND JAR FILE NOW

If you have any issues with 1.8.0 please revert back to your backup.  I may not be able to support issues caused by upgrading if there is not a backup available.

Now that is out the way.. on to the changes.

There is a whole new set of documentation: [https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs](https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs) please review this before upgrading to 1.8.0

Massive amounts of back-end changes and bug fixes.  You should see an increase in performance and things should generally run a lot nicer

Commands have been rewritten and some have been removed, refer to documentation.  In particular, /domain locate has been removed and is replaced with an expanded /domain search as it was already doing the same work.

Some 'staff' commands will not work and will not show in tab completions unless you are in domain bypass mode

Renting was rewritten from the ground up.  You can read more about the renting process here but the long and short of it is that any field with the config set to cost and days > 0 are rentable, there is a new gui in the menu where players can set the rent cost/days.  Rent signs no longer need any interaction and will self-populate.  Rented fields have their own name, welcome/farewell message and allowed lists.  When the rent period is up, these get removed and it reverts the name/messages/allowed list back to what it was before renting.

Spawner Fields! - These are special types of Domain fields that can be used to spawn mobs, much like using a Mob spawner.  You can read all about Spawner fields here - but they're really cool and have some great advantages over using a spawner block

Members Only fields have been created, this is not documented or easily accessible in game, but, you can create a field where only those with a particular permission can enter.  To apply, simply add:

    members_only_perm: YOUR_PERMISSION_HERE
    
It works like a PREVENT_ACCESS_TO_NONALLOWED but is permission based.

When converting a field to an Admin Block, then owner field is now removed completely.  You can now also convert an admin block back to a player block

Support Changes

It is worth mentioning changes to the support system.
Due to a number of charge-backs and paypal disputes, I've had the Discord modified to only show the #domain channel for registered buyers.  Everyone can still talk in #general and can request help there, but will need to present their spigot username in order to receive any help from the development team.  Trial copies are still available and will be supported as previously.
