# Change Log 1.9.5

This update allows Domain to play nicely with WorldGuard, but only in that it will not allow you to place a Domain block in a WorldGuard protected region.

Domain is, and will continue to be non-reliant on WorldGuard.

# Change Log 1.9.4

This update adds a new option in the block configuration

    snap_to_chunk: true

If true, snap to chunk will default the field to the dimensions of the chunk it is placed in. It is HIGHLY recommended that you set visualize_ring = true and visualize_corners = false in order to avoid lag displaying the field.

When snap to chunk is true, the default_radius, default_height_up, default_height_down, and ignore_y_axis will be disregarded.

Note that if you wish to retain this ONLY to the chunk it is placed in, also set prevent_resize = true.

An example of how to use this block is available in the miningrights.yml file https://torpkev.github.io/domain_docs/resources/blocks/miningrights.yml

# Change Log 1.9.3

/domain cancel command added - When resizing a field, this can be used to cancel the resize, remove visualization, and removes any wands you may have

Two new lang.yml entries required:

    command_resize_cancel: "&2Resize has been cancelled"
    command_resize_cancel_na: "&4You are not currently resizing a field"
