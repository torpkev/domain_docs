# Volume is the number of blocks available in the field. This is NOT necessarily the number of blocks being used. You can

# Field Order indicates the precedence of fields. The highest number is the field you would be considered indicate the field

# Block in field is a true/false field that indicates if the Domain Block must be within the field. If true, the block must remain
# within the cuboid during resizing, if false, then you can set the cuboid away from where the block is. This is convenient for spawn

# Flags are the most important thing in Domain - they decide what can happen inside a claimed area. Domain has over 200 different flags
# that can be applied. Keep in mind that some flags are for everyone, some are for the environment, some impact allowed players
# or non-allowed players etc.  Be mindful of what flags you apply, and when you nest fields (place one field within another) keep in mind
# that the child field can override the flag of the parent.
# For example, if you have a field that prevents monsters from spawning, and a child field that allows monsters to spawn, in the child
# field, the monsters would be allowed to spawn. This is only true however if it is contradictory. If you prevent doors being accessed
# in the parent field and only have monster spawning in the child field, doors will still not be able to be accessed in the child field.
# Each flag can be true or false. If true, that flag will be applied, if false, that flag will NOT be applied. If both a parent and a
# child field had for example PREVENT_SPAWN, with the parent set to true and the child set to false, in the parent field, mobs would not
# spawn. In the child field, mobs could spawn.

# one time and claim a field, over time this could include large amounts of prime real-estate. When the fields expire, the field becomes

# Merging blocks is used to increase the available volume within a field. When configured to allow it, a player could have a field with a
# 25,000 block volume, but may need more space. To save the player placing another field and having to maintain 2 fields, they can instead

# field, they would receive an error. This number can be overridden however by using the domain.BLOCK KEY.limit.NUMBER where block key is the
# key from the configuration and number is the limit. Whichever is higher is the limit applied to the player. So if it was 3 in the configuration,
